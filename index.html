 System Update
» I created the upgrade system is fully autonomous and intelligent. He performs the check for 
updates every X hours if have update is done automatically downloads all of the files.
» By checking update and made a post on the site with the customer data if the client is allowed to 
update the site returns an XML mapping of all available files, the updater works intelligently by 
checking which files are outdated or missing after verification is done downloading these files. When 
the download finishes is also checked if the file is corrupted so that the files that persists arrive 
intact.» Before you start installing the update and automatically backed up and if any errors occur during 
the installation and made the restoration of data and one of the great 
advantages that the system reverts to the only step that the error 
occurred. The site also has a mechanism that manages the downloads 
so not overloading the servers. The user has the possibility to backup 
and restore data manually.
» The Business developer has a real-time monitoring of customers who are upgrading and update 
history. The developer also has the option of releasing beta versions, or official test quickly and 
easily, making it possible to release a version for only specific clients or to all clients.

» I created the licensing system users with the function of being imburlável. Not allowing use of the 
system if there were outstanding debts. Licensing works with an XML file that has the data and their 
customer specific releases. The data is encrypted in an XML file and also by the MD5 security is 
recorded so that it is impossible to edit the file without being detected by the system. The licensing 
works seamlessly with system calls (responsible for customer management) and with the site so 
that when any data updates the clients receive at least two hours the updated license file.

<h3>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
